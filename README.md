# glhf

*Good luck, have fun* jamming on some video games!

`glhf` is essentially just combining ggez and glsp to make game jamming quick and fun.
The reason it's not called ggez-glsp or glsp-ggez is because it's not purely a set of bindings, and has some opinions on how the game will be structured and run.
It's basically a tiny engine built for game jams.

Currently a work-in-progress.
